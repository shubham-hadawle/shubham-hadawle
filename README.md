## About Me 🚀
Hi, I'm Shubham Hadawle, a passionate AI and Machine Learning enthusiast with a strong foundation in deep learning, natural language processing, and software development. Currently I'm working at Axis Bank as a GenAI Intern and I have a strong hold on Python, Backend Development, SQL, FLask.
I hold a Bachelor of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science from the University of Mumbai, where I developed expertise in machine learning algorithms, data analytics, and deep learning models. My work includes cutting-edge research in anomaly detection, text summarization, and real-world AI applications, leading to publications in Springer Journals.

Professionally, I have worked as a Deep Learning Intern at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), where I applied Neural ODEs, VAEs, and LSTMs to simulate nuclear reactor behavior. I’ve also served as a Training Assistant for Nvidia's Deep Learning Institute, educating over 200 students in TensorFlow, PyTorch, and advanced AI techniques.
Apart from AI, I have Android development experience, having built and published multiple apps—including an AI chatbot Synapse on the Google Play Store. My technical skills include Python, Java, C++, AWS, Microsoft Azure, and expertise in data pipelines, database management, and cloud computing.
Driven by curiosity and a passion for innovation, I am always eager to collaborate, explore new technologies, and push the boundaries of AI-driven solutions.
